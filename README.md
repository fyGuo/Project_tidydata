# Project_tidydata
## This repo includes three files
1. run_analysis.R which deal with the initial messy data(oh my god,it's really messy)and convert it into a tidy data.
2. Codebook which explains how the run_analysis.R deal with texts in each filefolds and connect them together.
3. tidydata which gives you a tidydata

## Procedure
I just follow the steps in the project requirements, and they are  
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.    
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
